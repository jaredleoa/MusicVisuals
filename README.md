# Description of the assignment
Our group visualization project is based on the song Killing My Love, which is a song with a high tempo. Our goal was to make a visual experience that matched this high tempo vibe, that feels as though the user who is running the program, is taken on a journey. Unfortunately we were unable to get the program to run as a single entity, which we are really disappointed about, as we had high ambitions and large ideas for the assignment. It turnt out to be too big of a task to put everything together. We learnt a lesson that is is better to keep things simpler and move from there, instead of starting big and trying to make a super complicated visual from the start.

## Instructions
To run the program, unfortunately you have to edit the main file each time to display each visual.

# How it works

## WarpedSpace

The WarpedSpace visual is a visual that is inspired by Star Wars, when they move through Hyperspace. My goal was to make this feels as dynamic and interactive as possible, as I am aware that a lot of people are inspired to make a visual similar to this. Therefore I wanted to make mine as unique and cool as possible. When they visual starts, the user can use the mousescroll wheel to achieve different things. The first is that when they scroll up, the star particles start moving much faster towards the screen, and the color of the particles randomly change. On the other hand, if the user decides to scroll down on the mousewheel, the particles start slowing down and appear to separate from each other, while also randomly changing colours. I am really happy with the overall functionality of this visual and how interactive it is.

## Celebration Station

The CelebrationStation visual was created to be another visual that is interact and constantly in motion, to match the theme of our song. To start off, I drew a wirefram box that has a gradient colors that slowly changes over time. Inside of this box there are a couple of cools things that take place. The first being the fireworks that randomly appear within the box. These fireworks vary a little bit in size and have a really cool looking color to it that contrats the background display of the visual. Inside of the wireframe box, the user can swap between spawning a triangle or circle, by using he right and left arrow keys. This wa another funcion I wanted to add as I wanted to make my visual as interactive as possible and fun for the user.

Another exciting adition was the camera movement I added. This allows the user to rotate the box and its contents in a 360 degree way. The box can also be rotated faster by using the up arrow, and slower using the down arrow. If the user wants to they can also use the mouse scroll button to zoom into the box, and even get inside of it! This gives this visual an even greater 360 feel which I find quite cool.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Jared:
I am most proud of how ambitious we were as a collective in trying to get a visual that was super interactive for the user. I am really happy with how the Warped Space visual turned out and I think it has a really unique twist to it. I am incredibly disappointed that we could not get everything to work and match the music, which is something I regret, but I don't regret trying to make it as much of an enjoyable and interactive experience as possible, even though it turned out to be too complicated to put together in the end. My goal is to put at least my visuals together and get it to work with the music in my own time
