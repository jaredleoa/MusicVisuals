# Description of the assignment
Our group visualization project is based on the song Killing My Love, which is a song with a high tempo. Our goal was to make a visual experience that matched this high tempo vibe, that feels as though the user who is running the program, is taken on a journey. Unfortunately we were unable to get the program to run as a single entity, which we are really disappointed about, as we had high ambitions and large ideas for the assignment. It turnt out to be too big of a task to put everything together. We learnt a lesson that is is better to keep things simpler and move from there, instead of starting big and trying to make a super complicated visual from the start.

## Instructions
To run the program, unfortunately you have to edit the main file each time to display each visual.

# How it works

## WarpedSpace

The WarpedSpace visual is a visual that is inspired by Star Wars, when they move through Hyperspace. My goal was to make this feels as dynamic and interactive as possible, as I am aware that a lot of people are inspired to make a visual similar to this. Therefore I wanted to make mine as unique and cool as possible. When they visual starts, the user can use the mousescroll wheel to achieve different things. The first is that when they scroll up, the star particles start moving much faster towards the screen, and the color of the particles randomly change. On the other hand, if the user decides to scroll down on the mousewheel, the particles start slowing down and appear to separate from each other, while also randomly changing colours. I am really happy with the overall functionality of this visual and how interactive it is.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
